            <div style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#0f0; font-size:xx-large;">I need to backup my files.</span><span style="color:#0f0; font-size:x-large;"><br>I have an endless collection of unpublished programs living on my pc, but if I ever lose it I'll lose all of them.</span></div><div style="text-align:left;"><br><br>Now of course github would be the first idea for fixing this, a free database where anyone can upload, however that has a few problems:<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;*</span> I want to be able to backup all of my files without worrying about exposing sensitive data, so a public repo wouldn't work.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;*</span> I want to be able to access the files from any device without sighing into github, so a privet repo wouldn't work.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;*</span> (I don't actually care about this one) If I store my code on github they can use it to train their ai models.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;*</span> It's boring.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;*</span> I don't know (yet) how to use github.<br><br>But while github won't work for storing my code in a readable format, if I first encrypted it then it wouldn't matter who has access to it, since without the key it's unusable.<br>And this fixes most of the problems,<span style="font-size:small;"> I'll still have to learn how to use github, but I probably should do that anyway...</span></div><div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:x-large;"><br><br>First iteration</span></div><div style="text-align:left;"><br>The first iteration was a bit too simple, to save:<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;*</span> It scans the folder recursively, copying each file to a local folder (this flattened the folder).<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;*</span> Then it encrypts each file, giving each a random name and putting its original path inside with the contents.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;*</span> It creates a git local repo and adds all the files to it.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;*</span> Finally it force pushes the local repo to the remote repo, overwriting any history.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;*</span> And to cleanup it removes the local folder and repo.<br>And to load:<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;*</span> First it removes all the current files.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;*</span> It it clones the remote repo to a local repo.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;*</span> It unencrypts each file and filepath.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;*</span> Finally it puts each unencrypted file in it's original path.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;*</span> And to cleanup it removes the local folder and repo.<br><br>And while this <span style="font-style:italic;">worked</span>, it has some pretty major design flaws, such as having to send the entire folder contents <span style="font-style:italic;">every operation</span>, this made it very slow and can be avoided by only sending the data that's changed, it also wastes space by creating three copies of the data; 1: the original data, 2: the encrypted data, and 3: the encrypted data as git blobs <span style="font-size:small;">(more on those later)</span>, when I really only need two: the unencrypted and encrypted data.<br><br>And while this first iteration isn't good enough, it does give me some useful requirements for the next version:<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;*</span> Only store two copies of the data locally, and only one on the remote repo.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;*</span> Don't copy / delete / encrypt / decrypt files unless needed.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;*</span> Keep a working history.</div><div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:x-large;"><br><br>Second iteration</span></div><div style="text-align:left;"><br>Using these new requirements I can start a new design, since I want to store change history and am already storing the backup on github it sounds like I want to use an actual git repo, however a git repo has two main parts: the working tree (this is the folder where I edit files), and the .git folder (this holds all of the repo's data), normally this would be fine, but since the repo stores encrypted data I don't directly use the working tree, and need to cut it out.<br><br>But first a little on repo structure: like I said a repo has two main parts: the working tree and the .git folder, but inside that .git folder there are three main things: blobs: these are the actual file contents, trees: these store the folder structure, with each tree pointing to any number of other trees or blobs, and commits: these store the order of changes along with the timeline and related info.<br><br>But an explanation like this is better with visuals, so if you'll take a look at the one below you'll see that 1: each file only has one blob, but a blob can represent any number of files, 2: a tree only stores pointers to other blobs / trees, not the blob's data itself, and 3: since redundant files are removed storing data like this can save significant space on larger folders.</div><div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-style:italic; font-size:x-small;"><br>(Interactive!)</span><span style="font-size:small;"><br>Example folder -> tree / blob structure</span><br><script src="repoStructure.js"></script> </div><div style="text-align:left;"><br><br>The commit portion I don't really have to worry about, but the trees and blobs are a problem, normally they are created by adding files from the working tree, but since I don't want a working tree I have to directly modify the trees and blobs (and the commits, but those are relatively simple), <br><br>But by far the biggest problem is avoiding unneeded encryptions / decryptions / file copying, and to do this I'm going to use an <span style="font-weight:bold;">index</span> file, this index is a giant object that stores every created file blob, every known file, all the current files, and the changelog from the last save.<br><br>Now since I already have a working system, I'll just talk about the huge optimizations I'll add, by walking step by step through each step for saving / loading.</div><div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:x-large;"><br><br>Saving</span></div><div style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;1.</span> Fetch the latest commit from the remote.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;2.</span> Decode the index from that commit. <span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;3.</span> Get a list of every local file.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;4.</span> Get a list of all the differences in the local files and the files in the index, checking to see if a file is the same by first checking the path, size, and mtime, then hashing and checking that if needed.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;5.</span> Clear the index's current files list.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;6.</span> Run through each local file and:<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;6.2.</span> Check if the index has a blob stored with this files hash, if not:<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;6.2.2</span> Encrypt the file to a temp folder.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;6.2.3</span> Create a blob out of the encrypted file.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;6.2.4</span> Store that blobs hash in the index's blobs array, using the files hash as the key.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;6.3.</span> Check if the index's saved files has a file with this files path and:<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;6.3.2.</span> If it does update its stats to be correct (size, mtime, hash).<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;6.3.3.</span> If it does not, create a new entry in the index's files for this file.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;6.3.</span> Check if the index's saved files has a file with this files path<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;6.4.</span> Add the files blob hash to an array to store all the current files blobs.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;7.</span> Encrypt the index and create a blob out of it, then add that blob's hash to the array of blobs.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;8.</span> Write all the blobs to a file.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;9.</span> Create a git tree using that file as input.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>10.</span> Create blobs out of all the raw files that stay in the repo (eg README.md, script.mjs, etc).<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>11.</span> Create a tree out of those blobs and the tree from the encrypted files tree.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>12.</span> Create a changelog out of all the changes gotten in step 4.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>13.</span> Commit the last tree.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>14.</span> Push the change to the remote repo.</div><div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:x-large;"><br><br>Loading</span></div><div style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;1-4.</span> The same as for saving.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;5.</span> Run through each change and:<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;5.2.</span> If the change is a new remote file:<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;5.2.2</span> Decrypt the file using the index's current files array to find it's blob.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;5.3.</span> If the change is a new local file:<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;5.3.2</span> Delete the file.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;5.4.</span> If the change is a modified file:<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;5.4.2</span> Delete the file.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;5.4.3</span> Decrypt the file using the index's current files array to find it's blob.<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;5.5.</span> If the change is a modified mtime:<span style="color:#0f0;"><br>&nbsp;5.5.2</span> Set the files mtime to the mtime of the file stored in the index's current files array.<br><br>Now in reality there are <span style="font-style:italic;">many</span> more steps, but that's the main flow of it all, with a few extra features to finish it off, such as an instal script you can run by copying a command from the repo, a global command added to the path for quick use, or checks to ensure you are connected to the internet when running operations, and many, <span style="font-style:italic;">many</span>, small optimizations everywhere to make running this thing not take multiple minutes, but only a few seconds.<br><br>If you want to try it out yourself you can see it (and install directions) on my github.</div>
